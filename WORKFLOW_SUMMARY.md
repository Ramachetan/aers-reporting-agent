# GitHub Workflow Summary - Quick Reference

## What is it?
A **Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline** that automatically builds Docker images for the AERS medical reporting application.

## When does it run?
- ✅ **Push to main branch** - Builds production images
- ✅ **Pull Request to main** - Validates changes before merge

## What does it do?

### Step 1: Setup
- Starts an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine
- Has Docker pre-installed and ready

### Step 2: Get Code
- Downloads your latest code from GitHub
- Includes all files needed for building

### Step 3: Build Docker Image
- Runs `docker build` command
- Uses the `Dockerfile` in your repository
- Creates image with timestamp tag (e.g., `my-image-name:1691234567`)

## The Build Process

### Stage 1: Compile Application
```
Node.js 20 → Install dependencies → Build React app → Generate static files
```

### Stage 2: Create Production Image
```
Nginx Alpine → Copy static files → Configure web server → Ready to deploy
```

## Why is this important?

### For Developers ✨
- **Instant feedback** if your changes break the build
- **Consistent environment** across all team members
- **Version tracking** with timestamped images

### For the Medical App 🏥
- **Regulatory compliance** with reproducible builds
- **Deployment ready** containers for cloud platforms
- **Reliability** for healthcare software requirements

### For Operations 🚀
- **Easy deployment** to Google Cloud Run, AWS, etc.
- **Rollback capability** with versioned images
- **Scalability** through containerization

## Current Workflow File
```yaml
# Location: .github/workflows/docker-image.yml
name: Docker Image CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag my-image-name:$(date +%s)
```

## What You Get
- ✅ **Automated testing** of your Docker build process
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** on build success/failure
- ✅ **Consistent builds** for the AERS medical reporting application
- ✅ **Container images** ready for cloud deployment

## Status Indicators
- 🟢 **Green checkmark** = Build successful, changes are safe to merge
- 🔴 **Red X** = Build failed, changes need fixing before merge

## Key Benefits for AERS Application
1. **Medical Compliance**: Ensures consistent, tested builds for healthcare software
2. **Cloud Ready**: Produces containers optimized for Google Cloud Run deployment  
3. **AI Integration**: Validates the containerization of Google Gemini AI integration
4. **Reliability**: Critical for adverse event reporting system uptime requirements

💡 **In Simple Terms**: Every time you push code or create a pull request, GitHub automatically tries to build your medical app into a Docker container. If it works, you get a green checkmark. If it fails, you get a red X and error details to fix.
